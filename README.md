### Welcome to my website!

#### My name is Grace, and I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Florida. Broadly, I research psycholinguistics. My master's research investigated bilingualism and its impacts on cognition. More specifically, I investigated the role of top-down (e,g., attentional control) or bottom-up (e.g., visual perception) processes in bilinguals' and monolinguals' performance on behavioral tasks. 

#### My dissertation research aims to investigate second language learners (L2) processing of a particular syntactic construction called negative polairty. I ask whether degree of pragmatic competency and of negation (so-to-speak) modulates indices of behavioral and neural performance in response to negative polarity.
